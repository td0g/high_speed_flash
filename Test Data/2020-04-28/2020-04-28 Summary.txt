Goal:
	Measure typical speedlight flash durations

Equipment: 
	Siglent SDS1200X-E Oscilloscope
	NQTRONIX Active Light Probe
	Integrating Sphere
	Canon 430EX-II
	Yongnuo YN560-II
	Nikon SB-900
	
Setup:
	Install 10-stop AND 6-stop ND filter in integrating sphere sensor port (active light probe clipping without both filters.  I need to get a 2-stop filter to fill in the gap.)
	Mount flash unit on top of integrating sphere
	
Procedure:
	3x pulses per full stop power
	eg. 3x @ 1/4, 3x @ 1/2, etc.
	Stopped @ 1/1 power
	Beginning at lowest power
		Nikon: 1/128, 1/64, 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1
		Canon: 1/64, 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1
		Yongnuo: 1/128, 1/64, 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1
	Coverage set to widest
		Nikon: 28mm
		Canon: 24mm
		Yongnuo: 28mm
	One extra test set performed with Nikon's diffuser on
	
Results:
	Nikon and Yongnuo have shorter durations than the Canon @ minimum power.  Note that Nikon & Yongnuo are 1/128 and Canon is 1/64 min power.
	Duration does not increase linearly with power.
	Going from minimum power --> minimum power + 1 is less than 2x duration.  Going from 1/2 to 1/1 power is several times the duration
	Interestingly, all three flash units seem to compensate for low power output with additional duration at higher power.  Just because the flash's ready light is illuminated doesn't mean it is FULLY charged.
	
Comments:
	Results are satisfactory
	Noise in the trace is mostly due to the very low signal input (a 10-stop ND filter wasn't quite strong enough to prevent clipping, the 16-stop total filter was way too much).
	Also, noise seems to be different depending on the mode that the probe's TPS61040 boost converter is operating in (PWM vs PFM)
